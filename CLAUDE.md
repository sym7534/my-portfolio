You are editing this repo in VS Code.

Goal: 1:1 recreation of my Figma styling across a next.js web app.

1) Use the connected Figma MCP server to extract design variables (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows).
2) Create a token system using CSS variables + Tailwind theme mapping.
3) Create base UI primitives (Button, Input, Card, Section, Container, Navbar) that match the tokens.
Constraints:
- Prefer tokenized values over arbitrary numbers.
- Match font sizes, weights, and line-heights exactly.
- Keep components reusable; don’t inline styles unless required.
When done, tell me which files changed and how to use the components.
